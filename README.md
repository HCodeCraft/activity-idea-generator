# Activity Idea Generator! #

## This web app will give you ideas on activities to do when you're bored or want to do something different! ##

The Activity Idea Generator web app allows you to access a database of activity ideas. You can display the activities by different categories - # of people, category, and price. There's also a random button that gives you a random idea suggestion. You are also able to add your own activity using the form on the website (the new activity will be desplayed with the other activities that are in the same categories after the page reloads).

Here's a video desplaying the app functionality:https://www.loom.com/share/c6e3002155234cca88fa817c30c01d16
